## Project Proposal

For this project, we are interested in a dataset consisting of information of a range of horror movies. The original dataset was adopted from the [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-11-01/horror_movies.csv) repo. The link to access the data is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-01/horror_movies.csv).

We will conduct inferential research with the dataset to explore the correlation between certain attributes of the horror movies, such as between its ratings and its generated revenue, its budget and its generated revenue, etc.  

Given that our main purpose is to explore the correlations between certain attributes, we plan to use hypothesis test on the samples drawn from the dataset. For ratings and revenue pair, we plan to divide the movies into two classes, one for higher ratings and the other for lower ratings, and perform hypothesis test that both classes would have about the same revenue. 

For exploratory data analysis, we will have a table for each numerical attribute with their mean, median, quartiles and standard deviations so that we get a rough idea on the distribution of data values. In addition, we will create some tick plots We will also have pairplots for the correlation between attributes to show the distribution of data points on a pair of attributes. 

For the analysis, we plan to have them on Jupyter Notebook. Therefore, the tables and plots will be saved as outputs. In the end, we will export the notebook as WebPDF to ensure proper display.
