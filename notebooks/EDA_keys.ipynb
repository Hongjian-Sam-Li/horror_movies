    "We want to explore the relationship between the ratings and the revenue for horror movies based on the dataset we collected. In specific, we want to answer the following question: do horror movies with a higher rating also have higher revenue than those with a lower rating. In this context, we will consider movies as highly rated if their ratings are above the median rating of all movies in the dataset, and movies as poorly rated if their ratings are below the median rating.

    "## Dataset Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Original purpose of creating this dataset (by the original author) is to explore a dataset about horror movies dating back to the 1950s. Data set was extracted from The Movie Datbase via the tmdb API using R httr. There are ~35K movie records in this dataset. There are 18 columns and we are going to focus on column `vote_average` and `revenue` columns for our study.\n",
    "\n",
    "When pre-processing the data, we decided to drop columns including: \n",
    "\n",
    "- original_title\n",
    "- overview\n",
    "- tagline\n",
    "- poster_path\n",
    "- status\n",
    "- backdrop_path\n",
    "- collection\n",
    "- collection_name\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we decided to drop observations which have a very low number for vote_count. There are several movies in the dataset which have only 1 or 2 total votes and then have vote_average=10.0. Therefore, we decided to filter out observations which have vote_count < 10 to ensure meaningful outcome of the experiment."
